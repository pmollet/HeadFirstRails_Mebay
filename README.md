HeadFirstRails_Mebay
====================

I started to learn Ruby on Rails using the O'Reilly book «Head First Rails». When I bought it, I didn't realise that it dates from 2009 and is based on Rails version 2. To my surprise (as a newbie) there are quite a few changes from Rails 2 to Rails 4 which I'm currently using.

There are a few resources that help upgrading the exercises in the book from Rails 2 to Rails 3. However, I didn't find much help for Rails 4.

Although I've learned a lot through trial & error, I'd like to provide here all the upgraded code for Head First Rails in version 4.
